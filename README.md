# Final-Coursework-TadasVinckas

http://vilniusaltfest.000webhostapp.com/

To begin with, I am a huge fan of alternative music. 
So I decided to create an imaginary festival in Vilnius. 
The main purpose of the page is, obviously, to convince website‘s visitors to buy tickets for this event. 
I tried to do this by creating the vibe of alternative music. I spend a lot of time matching colors and images. 
I believe that all of them capture the spirit of rock music perfectly. 
I also created a page for reviews so people could share their favourite moments from the festival - you just need to register and then you can create, delete, edit and read reviews.
From PHP side, I created an admin content management page where the user can edit and delete content of bands and info topics.

Technology: 

I used flexboxes and keyframes many times. 
Used Bootstrap carousel and navbar.
Included iframes for spotify, youtube, map.
Included plugins: lightbox, lazy load, page loading with showing gif.
Tried to reduce code as much as possible. Therefore, I took the majority of information from database. Also, I tried to avoid repeating PHP code by creating functions.
In addition, there is a text area in which you can include text and pictures, pagination and "remember me" feature.
Pages „My reviews“ and „Create review“ are not visible for non-registered users. Registered users are able to edit/delete only their reviews.

Plans for the future: 

To put more restrictions on registration form.
Add more tables for managing from admin side.
Add in admin side "create" opportunity.
Include Facebook login and likes.
Put an anchor link on button 'Buy tickets here' (Had some problems, so didn't make it).
Also to make some changes which could not let images expand reviews blocks on all reviews pages.
To show errors if text area or title is empty
